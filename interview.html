                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

                    <div>
                        CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.

                What is specificity among the ways of css styling?
                </summary>
                <div>
                    Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element.</div>

                                CSS syntax refers to the way we write CSS code. In order to write CSS, you need to first identify the element in your HTML page that you want to style before adding styles using a plethora of built-in CSS properties. There are multiple ways to identify and tell CSS which element in your HTML page it should style.

                                <div>
                                    A selector is a chain of one or more simple selectors separated by combinators. Combinators are: white space, ">", and "+". White space may appear between a combinator and the simple selectors around it. The elements of the document tree that match a selector are called subjects of the selector.

Pseudo-elements act as if you had added a whole new element to the DOM, and enable you to style that.

The selector(s), which in this example is h1 , points to an HTML element. The declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style the element with a property and value.
